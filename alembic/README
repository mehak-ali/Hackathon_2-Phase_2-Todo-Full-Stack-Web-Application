Generic single-database configuration.

This file is for the Alembic 'autogenerate' feature.

In order to use this script, you will need to have your model's
MetaData object available here.

For example, from your application:

    from myapp.mymodel import Base
    target_metadata = Base.metadata

This allows the 'autogenerate' feature to detect changes to your model
and generate migration scripts automatically.

Then, you can run Alembic like this:

    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Added account table"

And then run the migration:

    alembic upgrade head
